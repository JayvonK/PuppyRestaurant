- Puppy Restaurant

- Recreated a website for a Puppy Restaurant using html and css. We all collaborated together for the first time using branches in github, which was a challenge, for this project

- After the peer review from Isaiah, we fixed all the minor critiques Isaiah said we had

- Peer Review:
Robert Arias, Jared Ly, Halley Pham

Tablet and mobile all format correctly,the teams when scaled down turn into a carosel which is a nice way to scale down and make it fit. all menu items are alligned too  the nav works and scales correctly, so does the footer.


Peer Review: Isaiah Ferguson
Peer Review Critique:
-Menu- The images on the right are not lined up with the images on the left its causing all the line to be misaligned as well.

-Menu responsiveness- Some of the food cards have more white space on the bottom than other's might want to address the consistency issue.

-Catering- The "Our Catering Services" div needs more padding the text is hugging the container too closely it needs a bit more padding. You might want to take a sentence out of each paragraph and minimize the spacing between each line of text vertically. I think the space is technical term is called "Leading".

-Footer- is good however in the mobile / tablet the img is too close to the phone number add some margin in between them.

-background images-
Don't do this HTML is a semantic language if your card is describing a dog it should use an <img> tag with an alt attribute.
It is not technically wrong but going forward you must use <img> tags


Overall An amazing site with very few flaws. The use of carousels and accordians was really good!  great work keep it up!
